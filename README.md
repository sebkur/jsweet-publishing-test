# What's this?

This project serves an example about how to upload custom JSweet candies to a
Maven repository using Gradle. It makes use of the
[JSweet Gradle plugin](https://github.com/lgrignon/jsweet-gradle-plugin).

Use

    ./gradlew clean upload

to upload the artifact to a local Maven repository located at `/tmp/maven-repo`.
